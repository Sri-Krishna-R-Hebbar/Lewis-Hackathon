> A Better Way to Define is a website creation platform that allows users to build and visualize websites through interactive coding editors. Users can write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and see their website come to life instantly.

## How It Works
Code Editing: Use our three code editors to input your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
Word Search Challenge: Solve a word search puzzle containing HTML keywords. This challenge helps new coders learn HTML and provides an engaging experience for experienced developers.
Screenshot Submission: Submit a screenshot of your completed word search to our website.
Review & Execution: Your screenshot will be reviewed by Gemini. Once accepted, you can run your website and see your creation.
Our platform offers a hands-on approach to learning, enabling you to experiment and see results in real time while solving puzzles.
